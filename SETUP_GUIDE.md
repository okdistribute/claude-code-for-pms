## What You'll Be Able to Do

After completing this setup, you'll be able to:
- Generate Linear issues in Shape Up format from Slack conversations
- Pull in context from Notion documentation
- Reference existing Linear issues
- Create comprehensive feature requests in minutes instead of hours

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:
- [ ] A Mac computer (Intel or Apple Silicon)
- [ ] Admin access to your computer (ability to install software)
- [ ] Access to your company's Slack workspace
- [ ] Access to your company's Linear workspace
- [ ] Access to your company's Notion workspace
- [ ] About 30 minutes for the initial setup

## Step 1: Install Claude Code

Claude Code is the command-line interface for Claude that allows you to use MCP servers.

1. **Check if you have Claude Code installed:**
   - Open Terminal (find it in Applications > Utilities > Terminal)
   - Type `claude --version` and press Enter
   - If you see a version number, skip to Step 2
   - If you see "command not found", continue below

2. **Install Claude Code:**
   - Visit https://claude.ai/download
   - Download Claude for macOS
   - Open the downloaded file and drag Claude to your Applications folder
   - Open Claude from your Applications folder
   - Sign in with your Anthropic account (or create one)
   - Claude Code comes bundled with the desktop app

3. **Enable Claude Code:**
   - In the Claude desktop app, go to Settings
   - Look for "Developer" or "Advanced" section
   - Enable "Claude Code" or "CLI Access"
   - Restart Terminal

4. **Verify installation:**
   - In Terminal, type `claude --version` and press Enter
   - You should now see a version number

## Step 2: Get Your API Keys

You'll need API keys for each service. Follow the detailed instructions in [API_KEYS_GUIDE.md](./API_KEYS_GUIDE.md) for each service:

### Quick Overview:
- **Slack**: You'll create a personal bot (takes ~15 minutes)
- **Linear**: Your admin can provide this or you can generate your own
- **Notion**: Your admin can provide this or you can create an integration

**Important**: Keep these keys secure! Never share them or commit them to git.

## Step 3: Run the Setup Script

1. **Download this repository:**
   - Open Terminal
   - Copy and paste this command:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop && git clone https://github.com/your-company/feature-request-mcp.git && cd feature-request-mcp
   ```
   - Press Enter

2. **Make the setup script executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup-mcp-servers.sh
   ```

3. **Run the setup script:**
   ```bash
   ./setup-mcp-servers.sh
   ```

4. **Follow the prompts:**
   - The script will ask for your API keys
   - It will validate each key before proceeding
   - It will automatically configure all MCP servers
   - It will create test connections to verify everything works

## Step 4: Verify Everything Works

Run the test script to make sure all connections are working:

```bash
./test-mcp-connections.sh
```

You should see green checkmarks for:
- âœ… Slack connection successful
- âœ… Linear connection successful  
- âœ… Notion connection successful
- âœ… All systems ready!

If you see any red X marks, see the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

## Step 5: Your First Feature Request

Let's create your first feature request to make sure everything works!

1. **Interactive mode (recommended for first time):**
   ```bash
   ./generate-pitch.sh --interactive
   ```

2. **Follow the prompts:**
   - Enter a title for your feature request
   - Provide your Linear team ID (you can find this in Linear settings)
   - Choose small-batch (1-2 weeks) or big-batch (4-6 weeks)
   - Add any Slack threads, Notion pages, or other context

3. **Review the generated issue:**
   - The script will show you a preview
   - You can choose to create it in Linear or save it as a file

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**"Permission denied" when running scripts:**
```bash
chmod +x *.sh
```

**"Command not found: claude":**
- Make sure you've installed the Claude desktop app
- Restart Terminal after installation
- Try `/Applications/Claude.app/Contents/MacOS/claude --version`

**"Invalid API key" errors:**
- Double-check your API keys in the `.env` file
- Make sure there are no extra spaces or quotes
- Regenerate the key if needed

**Slack bot can't see channels:**
- Make sure your bot is invited to the channels
- Check that your bot has the correct OAuth scopes

**Can't find Linear team ID:**
- Go to Linear > Settings > Teams
- Click on your team
- The ID is in the URL: `linear.app/your-company/team/TEAM-ID-HERE`

### Running the Troubleshooting Script

If you're still having issues:

```bash
./troubleshoot-mcp.sh
```

This will:
- Check all prerequisites
- Validate API keys
- Test connections
- Provide specific error messages and solutions

## Getting Help

### Internal Resources
- Slack: #product-tools channel
- Notion: Search for "MCP Setup Help"
- Linear: Tag issues with `mcp-setup-help`

### Reset Everything
If you need to start over:
```bash
./reset-mcp-setup.sh
```
This will remove all MCP configurations and let you start fresh.
