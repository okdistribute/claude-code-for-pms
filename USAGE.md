## Linear Issue Format (Shape Up)

The system generates Linear issues following the Shape Up methodology:

### Generated Issue Structure

```markdown
# Problem

Articulate the problem that this piece of work addresses
What is the status quo and why does that not work?
Why does the problem matter?
Why is this the right time to address this problem?

# Appetite

How much time and resources are we willing to spend to address this problem?
[small-batch: 1-2 weeks | big-batch: 4-6 weeks]

# Solution

Give a "fat marker" sketch of the solution, identifying key architectural or design decisions. 
Tie the scope back to the appetite â€” are we confident we can build this with the resources we're willing to spend on it?
What are the constraints on the solution?

# Out of Bounds & Rabbit Holes

Identify and describe potential hurdles or areas of uncertainty in the proposed solution
Describe any areas that are intentionally out of scope
```
