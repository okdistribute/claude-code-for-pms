I'm going to give you a slack thread. In the FEAT team in linear, please make
feature request tickets based on the following
slack thread. There could be more than one feature request mentioned on this
slack thread. Intelligently try to parse out if this issue is tied to a
particular customer and what that customer's name is. additionally, add a label
for 'customer priority': either Nice to have, must have soon, or must have now
(Blocker) 

Once you've created the ticket(s), then look to see if there are any existing issues in linear on any team that look like they would be related to this ticket. Please mark them 'related to' in linear. Do not add them as links to the ticket, if you can't add related issues then just list them in a bulleted list in the text body of the feature request.

Usie this format:

Problem Statement

What problem is the customer trying to solve?  Please detail everything you can learn about the use case. Link any relevant video recordings, transcripts, data model, architecture diagrams and other supporting material

Justification

Why is it important to a customer? Is it blocking a rollout? Is it just annoying ergonomics?

Suggested Solution

If there's a clear thing that needs to be done "e.g. deliver X" then add it, otherwise leave this blank
