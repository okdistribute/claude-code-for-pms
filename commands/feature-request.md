I'm going to give you a slack thread, notion doc link, linear issue, or maybe
just file paths.

<thread>
$ARGUMENTS
</thread>

Think deeply. Did I give you enough information to create a feature request? do you need to ask me for more conext before getitng strated?

In the FEAT team in linear, please make feature request
tickets based on the following
slack thread. There could be more than one feature request mentioned on this
slack thread. Intelligently try to parse out if this issue is tied to a
particular customer and what that customer's name is. additionally, add a label
for 'customer priority': either Nice to have, must have soon, or must have now
(Blocker)

Once you've created the ticket(s), then:
1. Add any existing issues in linear on any team that look like they would be related to this
ticket.
2. Search for the customer's ID based on the name provided in the message.
3. Add the customer as a customer request to the linear issue. 


Use this format for output in the linear issue:

Problem Statement

What problem is the customer trying to solve?  Please detail everything you can learn about the use case. Link any relevant video recordings, transcripts, data model, architecture diagrams and other supporting material

Justification

Why is it important to a customer? Is it blocking a rollout? Is it just annoying ergonomics?

Suggested Solution

If there's a clear thing that needs to be done "e.g. deliver X" then add it, otherwise leave this blank

Deadline

If there is any clear deadline, summarize it here.
